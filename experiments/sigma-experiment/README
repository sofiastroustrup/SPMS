Code developed for simulation study comparing the sigma parameter.

Setup

Simulate data on star phylogeny (100 tips, T=1)
Root shape: butterfly forewing and butterfly hindwing 
Sigmas: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, â€¦ , 1.5
Alpha = 0.01
dt = 0.01
20 data sets per setting
Compute integration measure from:  An effect size for comparing the strength of morphological integration across studies
