Folder in which we carry out an simulation study exploring the effect of Procrustes alignment on parameter estimates. 

1- Simulate 20 data sets with dt=0.05, sigma=0.3 and alpha=0.005. As the root we use a simulated butterfly which have been procrustes aligned, such that its centroid size is 1.
2- For each data set infer posterior with and without procrustes alignment 
3- Compare estimated parameters with and without Procrustes alignment

Scripts:

To simulate data we run: simulate_data.ipynb
To procrustes align the simulated data we run: procrustes.R
To infer the posterior distribution we run: infer_posterior.ipynb
To evaluate convergence we run: analyze_results.ipynb 
To plot histograms we run: evaluate_bias.ipynb
