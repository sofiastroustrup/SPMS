In this folder we provide code for comparing ancestral reconstructions in geomorph and with MCMC. 

"Regarding these posterior estimates of ancestral states, I was also expecting given Figure 2 
that part of the simulation study would be to compare the ancestral states reconstructed using 
the presented approach and that using traditional methods. I could imagine an empirical researcher wanting to compare this approach to a full-covariance matrix approach that lacks shape-awareness 
and wanting to compare the ancestral states and costs of using one vs. the other. Providing an 
example of how one might do this with the simulated examples here could be useful, while also 
showcasing in the case of simulated examples how costly it is to use methods that are not shape-aware."

Workflow: 
Plan for ancestral state experiment: 
- simulate data om small tree + procrustes align
- estimate ancestral states using mcmc 
- estimate ancestral states using mvmorph
- Compare point estimates 
- Compare samples from inferred model 
- would be cool to look at the procrustes distance as a function of the parameters used for simulation (but this might be computationally too expensive). We would expect that errors become larger for the non-shape aware model as sigma gets smaller ??
