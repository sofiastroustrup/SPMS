In this folder we provide code for comparing ancestral reconstructions in geomorph and with MCMC. 

"Regarding these posterior estimates of ancestral states, I was also expecting given Figure 2 
that part of the simulation study would be to compare the ancestral states reconstructed using 
the presented approach and that using traditional methods. I could imagine an empirical researcher 
wanting to compare this approach to a full-covariance matrix approach that lacks shape-awareness 
and wanting to compare the ancestral states and costs of using one vs. the other. Providing an 
example of how one might do this with the simulated examples here could be useful, while also 
showcasing in the case of simulated examples how costly it is to use methods that are not shape-aware."

Workflow: 

1- Simulate data 
2- Procrustes align simulated data 
3- Infer ancestral states using geomorph
4- Infer ancestral states using our method 
5- Look at estimates, either MSE og just visually
6- Compare running times etc
