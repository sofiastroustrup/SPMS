Base function for analysis in "Stochastic Phylogenetic Models of Shape". 

To do: 
- should the kernel be divided by the number of landmarks ? 
- should backward filtering be done with Stefans approach ? 
- should we drop stratonovich ito correction ? 
- can we speed up the code? 
- can we make the code more numerically stable?

If I end up running everything again, then: 
- drop stratonovich-ito correction

Long term todo: 
- make tree traversals independent of ete3 package and more robust
