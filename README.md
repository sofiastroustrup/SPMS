# Stochastic Phylogenetic Models of Shape

This is code accompanying our paper "Stochastic phylogenetic models of shape". 

The base code is available in the folder bridge_sampling. Pipelines for all experiments in our paper are described in the jupyter notebooks. 

Data needed for running this code is publicly available on dryad: https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.2jm63xsq6 .
